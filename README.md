# MAking the china copy of the website using the Tailwind css

- First creating the Navbar by my own logic using the tailwind css.

## Tailwind css

- flex - It is necessary to apply the flex property before implementing the other properties.
- item-center - items are vertically centerized.
- justify-center - items are horizontally centerized.
- Responsive ke liye hm hmesha ulti logic deinge by default jo bhi hai rhne deinge hm phr sm,md,lg ki logic deinge
- flex-wrap se aik flex mein wrap krdega
- min-h-screen - its the minimum height of the screen
